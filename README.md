Yet another quirky random album generator!

This is a random album generator that contains three categories.. 
The classic 1001 lineup contains the usual greatest 1001 albums of all time yada yada yada schtick...
The creators 1001 contains 1001 albums from a lot of places.. mostly rym, /mu/ core stuff 
The essentials list contains 60 albums from a particular genre... mostly a mix of new and old... 

finally, if u do use this stupid site I spent an incomprehensible amount of time on, do take into notice the fact that sometimes it takes a bit of time to load an album... mainly bcoz I am broke and use render for hosting my backend and it spins out when its inactive for a while... delays usually dont take longer than 40-50 secs...

that's about it... this repo probably won't be updated for a while... unless I get some free time and get to make the next essentials list.. Enjoy and oi oi Saveloy!
